# HTML

**Introduction (pp.2-11):**

- This was a helpful 5000ft view of the basics of the how the web works. 

**HTML Chapter 1: “Structure” (pp.12-39):**

- Some of the foundations of how to setup an HTML website including descriptions of HTML tags and attributes.  I really like the graphic depictions of everything.   


**HTML Chapter 8: “Extra Markup” (p.176-199):**

- Because there have been several versions of HTML, it is crucial to use DOCTYPE declaration to let the browser know which version my page is using.

- An iframe -- or inline frame -- is like a window on a webpage where you can see another page.  Useful for maps and other elements.

- Comment code style is slightly different than in JS. <!-- -->



**HTML Chapter 17: “HTML5 Layout” (pp.428-451):**

- Lots of good examples of code for reference!

- Some browsers do not read HTML 5, so webpages may need an extra JS tag from Google to make them readable.


**HTML Chapter 18: “Process & Design” (pp.452-475):**

- Plan out the site before you get started. Use wireframes, sitemaps and sketches to plan out your users journey through the site.  Ask question like who is my site for, and what information presented is more important than other pieces.


# JavaScript

**Introduction:**

- A few good examples of functioning JS and how best to use the book as a reference.


**JS Chapter 1: “The ABC of Programming” (pp.11-52):**

- Think of a script like a recipe, or series of instructions.  What do I want the steps to be? What is the goal?\
- Define the goal, write the script, code each step.

- Try sketching out the tasks in a flow chart.

- Good analogy of object types and properties.

- Good reference for script tags.

- When the browser comes across the script element, it stops to load the script and then check to see if it needs to do anything
